# QR_GSWN

QR-GSWN Web application for sharing files over weblinks and QR codes

# Requirements 

This web application needs a working webserver with php7.x support
and a mariadb/mysql Server installed too. (typical LAMP setup is recommended)

The system user that runs the webserver needs permissions for basic file 
operations in the web root dir (e.g. /var/www/html/).
